        <p>Iceland is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean and the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Iceland is known for its stunning landscapes, including volcanoes, geysers, hot springs, and lava fields. Its climate is influenced by the Gulf Stream, making it warmer than its latitude would suggest.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Iceland was settled in 874 AD when the Norwegian chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island. Over the following centuries, Norsemen from Scandinavia established a unique commonwealth in Iceland. It remained independent until it became part of the Norwegian and later the Danish crown.</p>

It is characterized by its dramatic landscapes, which include waterfalls, glaciers, and black-sand beaches. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates meet, runs through Iceland, causing significant geothermal activity.</p>
